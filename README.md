# Random Forest Based Machine Learning Models for Forecasting Central European Cold Winter Weather

This repository provides Python-Code accompanying the paper " Kiefer et al. (2023): Can Machine Learning Models be a Suitable Tool for Predicting Central European Cold Winter Weather on Subseasonal to Seasonal Timescales?".


### Aim of the paper
Forecast of continuous timeseries of 2-meter temperature for Central Europe in the extended winter season (Nov - Apr) and forecast of the binary occurrence of cold wave days in the same region and time period

### Used methods
Climatological ensemble, Quantile Random Forests, Random Forest Classifiers

### Used data
ERA-5 reanalysis data (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset&text=ERA5), E-OBS observational data (https://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php)
